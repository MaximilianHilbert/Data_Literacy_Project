Abstract

An indication of an increasing spread between german rental prices is given by the
analysis of 2 472 German districts (cities) that contain several years of historical
data which depict a rise in inflation adjusted standard deviation between 2010
and 2017 of 19.5% and an average increase of 13.5%. In addition to that, there
is a trend that lower priced housing vanishes and the distribution of rental prices
develops a right handed heavy tail.
